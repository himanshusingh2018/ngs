gatk FilterMutectCalls
  Filters:
    base_qual         :	It is determined by factors such as sequencing technology, read depth, and alignment quality. Higher base quality scores indicate a higher level of confidence in the accuracy of the base call, while lower scores may suggest a greater likelihood of sequencing errors or uncertainty. 
    clustered_events	: The occurrence of multiple genetic variants in close proximity to each other within a specific genomic region. These variants may be observed in the same individual or across a population. Clustering of events can indicate various genetic phenomena, such as structural variations, repetitive sequences, or regions prone to mutation or recombination. The presence of clustered events can be of particular interest when studying genomic instability, genetic diseases, or regions associated with complex genetic rearrangements. 
    contamination     :	Contamination can arise from different sources, including cross-contamination between samples, contamination from reagents or laboratory equipment, or environmental contamination. Comparing the variant profiles across multiple samples or conducting additional analyses, such as principal component analysis, can help in discerning potential sources of contamination.
    fragment	        : In the context of FilterMutectCalls, the term "fragment" may be used to refer to the individual DNA fragments or sequencing reads that are used to identify genetic variants. The tool analyzes these fragments/reads to detect potential mutations or variant sites in the DNA sequence.
    germline          :	mutations inherited from parents and present in germline cells egg or sperm. population allele frequencies, sequencing depth, mapping quality, and other relevant parameters to determine the likelihood of variants being germline. 
    haplotype       	: Understanding the haplotypes can provide insights into the clonal composition, subclonal populations, and tumor evolution. However, it's important to note that haplotype-based analysis and phasing are generally more challenging in somatic mutation calling due to tumor heterogeneity, subclonal populations, and potential clonal evolution.
    map_qual	        : MAPQ values may indicate uncertain or poorly aligned reads and could contribute to the filtering of potential artifacts.
    multiallelic	    : The significance of identifying multiallelic variants lies in understanding the complexity and heterogeneity of the tumor sample. Multiallelic variants can provide insights into tumor evolution, clonal diversity, and the presence of subclonal populations carrying different mutations.
    normal_artifact	  : The identification and calculation of normal artifacts in FilterMutectCalls involve several factors and metrics. Some of these factors may include:
	  Allele Frequency  : Normal artifacts are often characterized by having a relatively high allele frequency in the matched normal sample. This indicates that the variant is not specific to the tumor sample and is likely present in both samples due to technical reasons.
	  Strand Bias       : Normal artifacts may exhibit a significant imbalance in the distribution of variant-supporting reads across the forward and reverse strands. Strong strand bias suggests a potential technical artifact rather than a genuine somatic mutation.
	  Mapping Quality and Base Quality: The quality scores of the aligned reads and base calls supporting the variant in the normal sample are considered. Low mapping or base qualities may indicate potential sequencing or alignment errors, contributing to the identification of normal artifacts.
	  Population Frequencies: FilterMutectCalls may utilize population databases or known variant frequencies to assess the likelihood of a variant being a normal artifact. If the variant is observed frequently in the general population, it is more likely to be classified as a normal artifact.
    PASS              :	reliable somatic mutations
    slippage          :	a type of sequencing or alignment error where there is a shift or misalignment of the sequencing reads or reference genome. If slippage-like errors are present in the sequencing or alignment data, they can manifest as discrepancies between the observed variant calls and the expected reference or known variants. 
    strand_bias       :	To determine strand bias, FilterMutectCalls calculates various metrics, such as the number of variant-supporting reads on each strand (forward and reverse) and the statistical significance of the observed imbalance. Strand bias refers to an imbalance in the distribution of DNA sequencing reads supporting a variant across the forward and reverse strands. 
    weak_evidence     :	the presence of variant calls that have lower confidence or supporting evidence for being true somatic mutations.
	                      Tumor and normal read support: The number of reads supporting the variant in the tumor sample and the absence or low number of supporting reads in the matched normal sample can influence the strength of evidence.
	                      Tumor allele fraction: The proportion of reads carrying the variant allele in the tumor sample can provide information about the clonality and abundance of the mutation. Lower allele fractions may contribute to weaker evidence.
	                      Strand bias: A significant bias in the distribution of variant-supporting reads across the forward and reverse strands may indicate potential technical artifacts or sequencing biases, leading to weaker evidence.
	                      Mapping quality and base quality: The quality scores of the aligned reads and base calls supporting the variant can impact the confidence in the variant call. Lower mapping or base qualities may contribute to weaker evidence.
	                      It's important to note that weak evidence does not necessarily imply that the variant call is incorrect or non-functional. It suggests that further investigation or validation may be needed to determine the true nature and significance of the variant.
